Sophie’s company has shipped more fruit than Johnson’s company has ordered. They are discussing how to deal with this situation. Suppose you are Johnson. Continue the negotiation by summarizing what you and Sophie have agreed on, giving your compromise solution to what has not been agreed on yet and explaining why.</span>
